Non-specific Gamelan Taiko Fusion (2006)
Perry R. Cook and Ge Wang

This piece is an experiment in human controlled, but machine synchronized 
percussion ensemble performance. Various percussive sounds are temporally 
positioned by PLOrk members, and the piece gradually transitions from 
tuned bell timbres to drums as the texture and density grows.
