Continuum
By Madeline Huberth & Ge Wang

Forward motion is.  A study in dynamics and balance; cyclic tendrils 
ebbing and flowing, swelling and retreating; timbres varying over 
pseudo-life-cycles; voices echoing in space and through windows into 
processes set in motion long before we are, and will continue long 
after; like ocean waves, unrelenting, not looking back.  Forward motion 
is.
